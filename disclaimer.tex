    Hello guys!\\
    These notes contain all the concepts and arguments which are explained
    during professor's lessons.
    However they are not intended in any sense as a replacement for professor's
    lessons, but as a help for studying and preparing the exam.
    Furthermore it's possible there are some errors and we don't take any responsibility
    of them. If you like
    to contribute for any correction, here is the link to the repository:

    \end{center}
    You can create a new branch with all modifications and create a pull request.
    We'll be pleasured for any correction in order to improve the qualiity of the document.\\
    Hope it could be useful.\\Cheers :)
