\subsection{Communication Media}
There are 3 types of communication:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard Communication
    \item Nano-mechanical Communication
    \item Molecular Communication
\end{itemize}
Here there is a detail description of all of them
\subsubsection{Standard Communication}
Characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item it can be used:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] electromagnetic waves:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item given the size of NM, wiring a large quantity
            of them is unfeasible
            \item wireless solutions could be used $\rightarrow$ hard
            integration of antennas
            \item energy required to power the antenna is too high
        \end{itemize}
        \newpage
        \item[$\rightarrow$] acoustic waves:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item it needs transducers in NM $\rightarrow$ ability to sense waves
            \item size of transducers is very high
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Nano-mechanical Communication}
Characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item information is transmitted through hard junctions
    between linked devices
    \item it requires physical contact between
    transmitter and receiver
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Molecular Communication}
Characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item transmission and reception
    of information are encoded in molecules
    \item Most promising approach for nano-networking:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] molecular transceivers are already present at nano-level
        \item[$\rightarrow$] transmitters and receivers can be remotely located\\
        $\rightarrow$ as far as the transmitted molecules can go
    \end{itemize}
    \item there are 2 types of approaches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] Short range communications:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item used for distances within mm
            \item Molecular motors:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item proteins $\Rightarrow$ transform
                chemical energy $\rightarrow$ mechanical work
                \item travel along molecular rails (microtubules), previously deployed
                \item data need to be encoded, transmitted and decoded
            \end{itemize}
            \item Calcium signalling:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Responsible for many coordinated cellular tasks\\
                $\Rightarrow$ fertilization, contraction and secretion
                \item flexible $\rightarrow$ there is no need of railways
                \item similar to broadcast networks\\
                $\rightarrow$ all near nano-machines can receive a broadcast message
            \end{itemize} 
        \end{itemize}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] Long range communications
        \begin{itemize}
            \item used for distances from mm to km

                \item molecular compounds contains information\\
                $\rightarrow$ info only decoded by specific receivers
                \item messages consist of molecules $\Rightarrow$ a lot of different combination
                $\rightarrow$ in ants colony the whole communication is based on this
            \end{itemize}
