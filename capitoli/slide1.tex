\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Wireless Development}

\textbf{Present}\\ it is constantly growing
due to higher use of laptops or devices which can
connect to internet. This implied an
important growth of WiFi and n-G (3G, 4G, 5G)
technologies also thanks to the emerging of
apps with both low and high data demand.
Smartphones open to new wireless scenarios such as
AR, VR, MR, tele-presence\dots Other topics are
Tactile Internet (combination of low latency, high
availability, reliability and security) and Web
Squared (integration of web 2.0 with technologies of
sensing).

\textbf{Future}\\ it is based on ubiquitous
communication among people and devices. So this implies
to take into account some requirements such as 
bandwidth, delay, energy and connectivity.

\textbf{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wireless channels are a difficult and
    capacity-limited broadcast communications medium
    (with respect to the wired counterpart);
    \item Traffic patterns, user locations, and network
    conditions are constantly changing;
    \item Applications are heterogeneous with hard
    constraints required by the network;
    \item Energy and delay constraints change design
    principles across all layers of the stack.
\end{itemize}
