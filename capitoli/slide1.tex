\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Wireless Development}

\textbf{Present}\\ it is constantly growing
due to higher use of laptops or devices which can
connect to internet. This implied an
important growth of WiFi and n-G (3G, 4G, 5G)
technologies also thanks to the emerging of
apps with both low and high data demand.
Smartphones open to new wireless scenarios such as
AR, VR, MR, tele-presence\dots Other topics are
Tactile Internet (combination of low latency, high
availability, reliability and security) and Web
Squared (integration of web 2.0 with technologies of
sensing).

\textbf{Future}\\ it is based on ubiquitous
communication among people and devices. So this implies
to take into account some requirements such as 
bandwidth, delay, energy and connectivity.

\textbf{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wireless channels are a difficult and
    capacity-limited broadcast communications medium
    (with respect to the wired counterpart);
    \item Traffic patterns, user locations, and network
    conditions are constantly changing;
    \item Applications are heterogeneous with hard
    constraints required by the network;
    \item Energy and delay constraints change design
    principles across all layers of the stack.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multimedia requirements}

        Data Rate & 8-32 Kbps & 1-100 Mbps & 1-20 Mbps & 32-100 Kbps \\

One-size-fits-all protocols and design
\begin{itemize}
    \item are used by wired networks $\rightarrow$ poor results;
    \item do not work well $\rightarrow$ Crosslayer design.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Crosslayer Design}

It's made of 5 layers:

\begin{minipage}{.2 \linewidth}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|}
        \hline
        Application\\
        \hline
        Network\\
        \hline
        Access\\
        \hline
        Link\\
        \hline
        Hardware\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.2 \linewidth}
    \begin{tabular}{l}
        $\rightarrow$ Meet delay, rate and energy constraints\\
        $\rightarrow$ Adapt across design layers\\
        $\rightarrow$ Reduce uncertainty through scheduling\\
        $\rightarrow$ Provide robustness via diversity\\
        \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Wireless Systems}
There are different types of current wireless systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cellular Systems;
    \item Wireless LANs;
    \item Satellite Systems;
    \item Bluetooth;
    \item Ad hoc Wireless Network;
    \item Mesh Network;
    \item Sensor Network;
    \item Distributed Control Network;
    \item MANET/VANET/FANET;
    \item Underwater Networks;
    \item RFID;
    \item Nano-networks;
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
